OK  A backtick string is a string of one or more backtick characters (`)

OK  A code span begins with a backtick string
OK  and ends with a backtick string of equal length.

OK  normalized in the following ways:
OK    * line endings are converted to spaces.
OK    * if the resulting string both begins and ends with a space character,
OK      but does not consist entirely of space characters,
OK      a single space character is removed from the front and back.")

(comment "Emphasis, Strong Emphasis

OK  A delimiter run is
OK  either a sequence of one or more * characters
OK  that is not preceded or followed by a non-backslash-escaped * character,
OK  or a sequence of one or more _ characters that is not preceded or followed by a non-backslash-escaped _ character.

OK  A left-flanking delimiter run is a delimiter run that is
OK  (1) not followed by Unicode whitespace,
OK  and either (2a) not followed by a punctuation character,
OK  or (2b) followed by a punctuation character
OK  and preceded by Unicode whitespace or a punctuation character.

OK  A right-flanking delimiter run is a delimiter run that is
OK  (1) not preceded by Unicode whitespace,
OK  and either (2a) not preceded by a punctuation character,
OK  or (2b) preceded by a punctuation character
OK  and followed by Unicode whitespace
OK  or a punctuation character.

OK  The beginning and the end of the line count as Unicode whitespace.

    The following rules define emphasis and strong emphasis:
      1. A single * character can open emphasis iff it is part of a left-flanking delimiter run.
      2. A single _ character can open emphasis iff it is part of a left-flanking delimiter run and
         either (a) not part of a right-flanking delimiter run
         or (b) part of a right-flanking delimiter run preceded by punctuation.
      3. A single * character can close emphasis iff it is part of a right-flanking delimiter run.
      4. A single _ character can close emphasis iff it is part of a right-flanking delimiter run and
         either (a) not part of a left-flanking delimiter run
         or (b) part of a left-flanking delimiter run followed by punctuation.
      5. A double ** can open strong emphasis iff it is part of a left-flanking delimiter run.
      6. A double __ can open strong emphasis iff it is part of a left-flanking delimiter run and
         either (a) not part of a right-flanking delimiter run
         or (b) part of a right-flanking delimiter run preceded by punctuation.
      7. A double ** can close strong emphasis iff it is part of a right-flanking delimiter run.
      8. A double __ can close strong emphasis iff it is part of a right-flanking delimiter run and
         either (a) not part of a left-flanking delimiter run
         or (b) part of a left-flanking delimiter run followed by punctuation.
      9. Emphasis begins with a delimiter that can open emphasis
         and ends with a delimiter that can close emphasis,
         and that uses the same character (_ or *) as the opening delimiter.
         The opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate delimiter runs.
         If one of the delimiters can both open and close emphasis,
         then the sum of the lengths of the delimiter runs containing the opening and closing delimiters
         must not be a multiple of 3 unless both lengths are multiples of 3.
     10. Strong emphasis begins with a delimiter that can open strong emphasis
         and ends with a delimiter that can close strong emphasis,
         and that uses the same character (_ or *) as the opening delimiter.
         The opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate delimiter runs.
         If one of the delimiters can both open and close strong emphasis,
         then the sum of the lengths of the delimiter runs containing the opening and closing delimiters
         must not be a multiple of 3 unless both lengths are multiples of 3.
     11. A literal * character cannot occur at the beginning
         or end of *-delimited emphasis
         or **-delimited strong emphasis,
         unless it is backslash-escaped.
     12. A literal _ character cannot occur at the beginning
         or end of _-delimited emphasis
         or __-delimited strong emphasis,
         unless it is backslash-escaped.

    Where rules 1â€“12 above are compatible with multiple parsings, the following principles resolve ambiguity:
     13. The number of nestings should be minimized.
         Thus an interpretation <strong>...</strong> is always preferred to <em><em>...</em></em>.
     14. An interpretation <em><strong>...</strong></em> is always preferred to <strong><em>...</em></strong>.
     15. When two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans overlap,
         so that the second begins before the first ends
         and ends after the first ends,
         the first takes precedence.
         Thus *foo _bar* baz_ is parsed as <em>foo _bar</em> baz_
         rather than *foo <em>bar* baz</em>.
     16. When there are two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans
         with the same closing delimiter,
         the shorter one (the one that opens later) takes precedence.
         Thus **foo **bar baz** is parsed as **foo <strong>bar baz</strong>
         rather than <strong>foo **bar baz</strong>.
     17. Inline code spans, links, images, and HTML tags group more tightly than emphasis.
         So, when there is a choice between an interpretation that contains one of these elements
         and one that does not, the former always wins.
         Thus *[foo*] (bar) is parsed as *<a href= "bar">foo*</a>
         rather than as <em> [foo</em>] (bar).")
